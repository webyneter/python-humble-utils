Ways You Can Help Us
--------------------

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

`Create an issue`_ corresponding to the bug you have found complying with
the project's issue template.

.. _`Create an issue`: https://github.com/webyneter/python-humble-utils/issues/new


Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues: Anything tagged with ``bug`` and ``help wanted``
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Make sure to submit clean, concise, well-tested pull requests only, so it is easier
for contributors to review it; strive to deliver as short and atomic pull requests
as possible as this will dramatically increase the likelihood of those being merged.


Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with ``enhancement``
and/or ``help wanted`` and/or without an ``Assignee`` is open to whoever
wants to implement it.


Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs,
in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.


Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to `file an issue`_.

.. _`file an issue`: https://github.com/webyneter/python-humble-utils/issues/new

If you are proposing a feature,

* explain in detail how it would work;
* keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement;
* remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, so contributions are welcome!
